        <h1>Fox Story</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a deep forest lived a strong fox. The fox was known to be a clever animal. One day, he thought of crossing the river in hope of finding food on the banks of the river. He then decided to swim across the river to reach the other side. But the river was very deep and flowing very fast.</p>
            <p>As the fox jumped into the river to swim, he got dragged along the flow of the river.</p>
            <p> He tried and tried to reach the bank, but could not do so as the river had a great flow. The fox soon ended up in a small ditch. He thanked god as he was saved from drowning, but he realised that he was badly injured because of stumbling on the pebbles and rocks. The fox coughed up water from the lungs and remained in the ditch.</p>
           <p>Soon some hungry flies flew across the fox. The flies started sucking blood from the body of the fox. As the fox was too injured to remove the flies he stayed in the ditch. As some time passed by, a pig passed through the ditch. The pig saw the fox and felt remorse for the fox.</p>
            <p>The pig approached the fox and asked if he could help the fox. The fox replied that there is nothing that the pig can do to help the fox. The pig then offered to remove the flies. Listening to this the fox replied, “My dear pig please do not remove the flies from my body.” </p>
