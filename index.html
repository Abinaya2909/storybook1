            <p>An adventure is an event or series of events that happens outside the course of the protagonist's ordinary life, usually accompanied by danger, often by physical action. Adventure stories almost always move quickly, and the pace of the plot is at least as important as character.
            Variations kept the genre alive. From the mid-19th century onwards, when mass literacy grew, adventure became a popular subgenre of fiction. Although not exploited to its fullest, adventure has seen many changes over the years – from being constrained to stories of knights in armor to stories of high-tech espionage.</p>

            <article id="arti2"><h3>Thriller Book</h3><img src="thrillerimg.jpeg">
            <p>The novel explores human nature and the main theme being secrets. The book begins with ten characters, all strangers to one another, who are invited by an unknown host on an isolated island off the coast of Devon.  One by one they start dying, and it is up to the last few survivors to figure out who’s behind these grisly murders.
                This is one of the best psychological thriller books hands down.It’s a gripping story from page one that will keep you up until late in the night as you devour every word on your Kindle screen.  The main character is Theo Faber, a psychotherapist who treats Alicia Berenson who has seemingly gone mute after “killing” her husband. As the book unravels what truly happened that day, the plot twists and turns at every corner.</p>
